## Special precautions for Windows
As installer [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) is used. You have to install it (version 3.0), and add NSIS folder to PATH in Environment Variables, so it is reachable to scripts in this project (path should look something like `C:/Program Files (x86)/NSIS`).
