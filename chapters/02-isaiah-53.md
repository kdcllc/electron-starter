> **[Isaiah 53](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+53&version=ESV)** (ESV)
>   
> 53&nbsp; Who has believed what he has heard from us?<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?<br />
> <sup>**2**</sup> For he grew up before him like a young plant,<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and like a root out of dry ground;<br />
>  he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no beauty that we should desire him.<br />
> <sup>**3**</sup> He was despised and rejected by men;<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief;<br />
> and as one from whom men hide their faces<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was despised, and we esteemed him not.<br />
> <sup>**4**</sup> Surely he has borne our griefs<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and carried our sorrows;<br />
> yet we esteemed him stricken,<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smitten by God, and afflicted.<br />
> <sup>**5**</sup> But he was pierced for our transgressions;<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was crushed for our iniquities;<br />
> upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with his wounds we are healed.<br />
> <sup>**6**</sup> All we like sheep have gone astray;<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have turned—every one—to his own way;<br />
>  and the Lord has laid on him<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the iniquity of us all.<br />
> <sup>**7**</sup> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet he opened not his mouth;<br />
>  like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so he opened not his mouth.<br />
> <sup>**8**</sup> By oppression and judgment he was taken away;<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as for his generation, who considered<br />
> that he was cut off out of the land of the living,<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stricken for the transgression of my people?<br />
> <sup>**9**</sup> And they made his grave with the wicked<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with a rich man in his death,<br />
> although he had done no violence,<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there was no deceit in his mouth.<br />
> <sup>**10**</sup> Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him;<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has put him to grief;<br />
>  when his soul makes an offering for guilt,<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days;<br />
>  the will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.<br />
> <sup>**11**</sup> Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied;<br />
> by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make many to be accounted righteous,<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he shall bear their iniquities.<br />
> <sup>**12**</sup> Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many,<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he shall divide the spoil with the strong,<br />
> because he poured out his soul to death<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and was numbered with the transgressors;<br />
>  yet he bore the sin of many,<br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and makes intercession for the transgressors.
